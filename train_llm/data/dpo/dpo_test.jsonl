So, each watermelon loses \\(11 \\times 0.015 = 0.165\\) pounds.\n   - The total weight lost due to evaporation for all watermelons is \\(5 \\times 0.165 = 0.825\\) pounds.\n   - However, it's mentioned that 66% of the loss is due to evaporation.

Since each watermelon weighs 11 pounds, the total weight of the discarded watermelons is \\(20 \\times 11 = 220\\) pounds.\n   - However, the initial weight of the bushel was 55 pounds, which means the calculation above is incorrect in the context of the discarded watermelons. The 20 watermelons discarded are in addition to the initial 5 watermelons in the bushel. This discrepancy suggests that the 55 pounds is the weight of the watermelons after some have been discarded, not the initial weight.

However, this information seems to be out of context with the initial 55-pound bushel. Assuming the 55 pounds is the weight after the watermelons have been partially consumed and some discarded, we need to focus on the weight of the watermelons that were actually consumed.\n\n4. **Calculate the weight of the watermelons consumed:**\n\n   - Since the 55 pounds is the weight after some watermelons have been discarded and the rest have lost weight due to evaporation, we need to calculate the weight of the watermelons consumed based on the information given.\n   - The total weight of the watermelons after evaporation and before the 20 watermelons were discarded would have been \\(55 + 220 = 275\\) pounds (assuming the 55 pounds is the weight after the 20 watermelons were discarded and the evaporation loss).\n   - However, since we know the evaporation loss is 1.25 pounds (from the initial calculation, which we now know is not directly applicable due to the discrepancy with the discarded watermelons), the weight before evaporation would have been \\(275 + 1.25 = 276.25\\) pounds.\n\n5. **Determine the number of people at the party:**\n\n   - Each person eats an average of 8.6 pounds of watermelon.

These functions take a single argument - the decimal number to be converted - and return the resulting binary, hexadecimal, and percentage representations respectively.\n\nNext, we define a main function called `__main__`. Inside this function, we prompt the user to enter a decimal number, call our conversion functions to generate the output strings, and finally print the results.\n\nThe key idea behind this implementation is to break down the decimal number into individual digits, perform the necessary calculations to obtain the desired representation, and concatenate the results together to form the final output string. The choice of programming language here was arbitrary, but Python was chosen due to its popularity among developers and ease of readability.\n\nNow let us discuss why these conversions are important in computer science and digital systems. First off, computers work with binary numbers internally, so converting decimal numbers into their binary equivalents allows them to be processed efficiently by hardware components like microprocessors and memory chips. Similarly, hexadecimal notation provides a compact way to represent large binary values, making it useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Lastly, percentages allow us to express proportions accurately without having to deal with fractions or decimals, which makes them ideal for representing probabilities and statistical distributions in scientific computing applications.\n\nOverall, understanding how to convert between different numerical bases is crucial for anyone working with computers or electronic devices. By mastering these concepts early on, one can gain valuable insights into how modern technologies operate and develop skills that will serve them well across various fields ranging from software development to engineering design.", "role": "assistant"}]}
